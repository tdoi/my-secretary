# Talk Script: Performance Discussion Meeting

---

## Opening

"Thank you for meeting with me today. As we discussed before, I'd like to hear your decision."

"In December and January, we talked about your performance and the path forward. You said you wanted some time to think. So today, I want to hear what you've decided."

---

## Ask for Their Decision

"So, what have you decided? Do you want to continue working here, or have you decided to move on?"

---

## Scenario A: They Say "I'll Leave in February"

"I understand. Thank you for being honest with me."

"Let's make sure the transition is smooth. You can use your remaining paid leave before the end of February."

"If you need a reference letter in the future, let me know and we can discuss it."

"Is there anything you need from us during this transition period?"

→ **End: Voluntary resignation (自己都合)**

---

## Scenario B: They Say "I Want to Continue"

"I appreciate you being direct with me. Let me be direct with you too."

"Based on what I've seen over the past year, and especially since our December conversation, I haven't seen the improvement we need. To be honest, I don't think continuing in your current role is working for either of us."

**[Pause - let them respond if they want]**

"So I want to offer you an option."

"If you agree to leave by the end of February, we can process this as a company-initiated separation. This means you can receive unemployment insurance immediately, without the waiting period. You can also use your remaining paid leave."

"This is a better outcome for you financially, and it gives you time to focus on finding your next opportunity."

**[Pause]**

"What do you think?"

---

### If They Accept the Offer

"Thank you for understanding. I think this is the best path forward for both of us."

"Let's work out the details with HR. We'll make sure everything is handled properly."

"I genuinely hope you find a role that's a better fit for your skills."

→ **End: Agreed separation, company-initiated (会社都合)**

---

### If They Refuse the Offer

"I understand. You have the right to choose to continue."

"In that case, we will move forward with a Performance Improvement Plan. Let me explain what that means."

**[Hand over PIP document]**

"This document outlines the specific improvements we need to see by the end of January."

"If improvement is not observed, your Impact Level will drop from 3 to 1, and your salary will decrease by approximately [XX]%."

"But I want to be honest with you - even beyond the salary reduction, if there's no improvement, there won't be meaningful work for you to do here."

"At that point, I would ask you to seriously consider whether staying is the right choice for you."

"I'm not saying this to threaten you. I'm saying this so you understand the full picture before you decide."

"I want you to read this carefully. Do you have any questions?"

**[Answer questions if any]**

"I need your signature to confirm you've received and understood this document. Your signature doesn't mean you agree with everything - it confirms you understand what's expected."

**[Get signature]**

"We'll have a review meeting at the end of January to assess your progress."

"I want to be clear: I hope you succeed. But I also need to be honest that significant change is required."

→ **Next: PIP period begins**
